# FlashCards 
## Summary

This project was designed to practice and enhance my understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test Driven Development (TDD). I was tasked with creating a flash card game where you would be prompted with a question and would have some multiple choice answer options. 

## Setup Instructions 

Fork this repo and clone it (from your GitHub).

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and once in the directory run the following command to start the game: 

```bash
node index.js
```

### Example of Flash Cards game:

Once the game begins, you will be prompted with a question and some possible answers. Upon selecting the answer, the game will provide immediate feedback for the answer and it will also let you know once the cards are done and your total correct score percentage.
